We will regularly check the Data Plans offered by Optus to see whether you have the most suitable Data Plans for your network. If we think you should change a Data Plan, we will tell you. We will also tell you if we become aware that your usage exceeds your current data limits.  If you exceed the data limits under a Data Plan for any reason, you must pay the excess usage charges that apply. </p>
