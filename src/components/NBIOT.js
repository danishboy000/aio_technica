                    <h4 class = 'mb-25 mt-25'>What is NB-IoT?</h4>
                    <p class = 'mb-25 mt-25'>NB-IoT is a low-power, wide-area cellular network (LPWAN) technology which uses 200KHz of bandwidth to transfer data. Generally, the maximum upload data transfer rate is around 62.5kb per second. The slightly slower data transfer rate is offset by lower power consumption and device affordability.</p>
                    <p class = 'mb-25 mt-25'>Despite offering excellent stationary range and penetration, it is important to note that the NB-IoT network does not support cell tower handover. This means that if devices move out of frequency range, the signal connection will fail.</p>
                    <h4 class = 'mb-25 mt-25'>Should I Be Using NB-IoT For My Deployments?</h4>
                    <p class = 'mb-25 mt-25'>NB-IoT is designed for simple devices which infrequently send data, and require a longer battery life.</p>
                    <p class = 'mb-25 mt-25'>If you have widely-deployed devices in the field (such as gas, electricity or water meters, environmental sensors, or building automation) that do not need to send frequent updates, this may be a suitable technology for your requirements.</p>

                    <div class="et_pb_text_inner"><ul>
<li>All customers need to be qualified by AIO Technica staff before getting access to NB-IoT services.</li>
<li>Customers must have a standard account with AIO Technica before applying for NB-IoT services (Create account here: <a href="/get-connected/">Get Connected</a>).</li>
<li>NB-IoT services are controlled by a separate CISCO Jasper M2M Control Centre and are not able to be migrated to your existing Control Centre account or SIM Cards.</li>
<li>Voice &amp; SMS are not available on NB-IoT Services.</li>
<li>NB-IoT services are sold as ‘Tokens’ – Each Token represents a pre-set amount of data per SIM per month:
<ul>
<li>Bronze – 85KB</li>
<li>Silver – 256KB</li>
<li>Gold – 427KB</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NB-IoT Tokens are sold in ‘Packs’ with 100 Tokens being the minimum.</li>
<li>NB-IoT Tokens will be consumed under 3 conditions:
<ol>
<li><strong>Activation</strong> – When a SIM Card is changed to Activated State</li>
<li><strong>Renewal</strong> –&nbsp; Any SIM Cards that are Active at the start of a new billing month will use a token to cover the new month.</li>
<li><strong>Top-Up</strong> – usage above your pooled allowance will automatically consume NB-IoT Tokens to cover excess data used</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>NB-IoT Tokens do not pro-rate and all associated data expires at 23:59 at the end of each calendar month.</li>
<li>Moving up or down Token class (Bronze/Silver/Gold) will take effect from the first day of the following calendar month.</li>
<li>If your available Token Balance is less than your current number of active services on the first day of the calendar month then you will automatically be invoiced for the lowest applicable Token Pack to cover all of your active services for the month.</li>
<li>NB-IoT Tokens of the same level only allow pooling/aggregation (e.g. Bronze can not pool with Silver or Gold).</li>
<li>Token Packs shall expire after 24 months.</li>
